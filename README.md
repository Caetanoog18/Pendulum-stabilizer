# Pendulum Stabilizer

This project aims to analyze the application of three controller tuning techniques — pole placement, root locus, and Ziegler-Nichols — 
in both continuous and discrete domains, applied to the control of a pendulum on a moving base positioned downward.  
The comparisons are carried out based on the closed-loop responses, verifying whether the design criteria such as settling time, 
overshoot, and steady-state error are met.
Additional goals include the construction of a physical prototype, the mathematical modeling of the system, and the development of an interactive interface, allowing real-time adjustment of controller parameters for didactic purposes and experimental analysis.
